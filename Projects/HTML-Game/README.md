Coin Flip Game

Flip the coin.

# TODO
- when the user clicks the button 
    - get the image to change from heads to tails or vice versa
- Add the randomness to the flip so it's 50% of the time heads and 50% of the time tails
- Each time the user flips a coin, the result should be added to a tally -- heads or tails

Stretch Goals
- Flip animation
