First Things First - What You'll Need
Prior to running this project, here are the pre-reqs you'll need. Please make sure you've got these installed on your computer:

Node.js: This runs the app. You'll want version 16 or later to keep things smooth.
npm Node Package Manager.
Keep in mind I use VS Code for my code editor and Mac Book
Okay, Let's Get This Show on the Road! ðŸš€
Here's installation instructions to get the app running on your machine:

Grab the Code
First, you'll need to clone the repository. Basically, you're copying the code from GitHub to your computer. Pop this command into your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/courjimen/Endangered-Animals.git
Get the Server and Client Folders Ready
Since I run this both folders concurrently, you will need to install the dependencies in the root of my project (at the same level of the client and server folders) Run this command:

npm install
Once everything is installed you can run:

npm run dev
This will run both folders and open the app. You should see this in your terminall: 


Fire It Up! ðŸ”¥
Finally, we're ready to run the app! Back in the main project directory, type:

npm run dev
This will start both the server and the client. You should be able to see the app in your browser at http://localhost:5173/. The server will be running on http://localhost:3000/sightings or /individuals endpoint.
